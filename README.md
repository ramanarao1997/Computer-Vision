# Computer-Vision
In this repository I will be implementing various techniques which are commonly used in the computer vision community.

In the Corner Detection directory I have implemented Moravec corner detection algorithm and Harris corner detection algorithm.

The Panorama directory contains implementations for image stitching that can generate panorama with two images.

Optical flow and Motion Segmentaion directory contains implementations of optical flow algorithms like Lucas–Kanade and Horn–Schunck and motion segmentation techniques like simple background subtraction, non-adaptive frame differencing, adaptive frame differencing and persistent frame differencing algorithms.

# HOW TO RUN

1) Open jupyter notebook with the follwing command:
--NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=1.0e10

2) Run the ipython notebooks present in the respective folders to see the results.
